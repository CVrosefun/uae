Uncertainty Autoencoders
============================================

This repository provides a reference implementation for learning uncertainty autoencoders as described in the paper:

> Uncertainty Autoencoders: Learning Compressed Representations via Variational Information Maximization 
Aditya Grover, Stefano Ermon  
International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2019 
Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01442

## Requirements

The codebase is implemented in Python 3.6 and Tensorflow. To install the necessary requirements, run the following commands:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 

** NOTE: ** An experimental reimplementation is available in pytorch_src/ folder. Use at own risk.
